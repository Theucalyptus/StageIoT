# Example Dataset 1
In this dataset, we have on client, equiped with the OAK-D camera looking at an intersection.
The `db_Objects_<date>.csv` and `db_test1_<date>.csv` files are exports of the corresponding tables in the mariaDB database of the server, while the folder `dev_test1_logs` contains the logs of the client.
