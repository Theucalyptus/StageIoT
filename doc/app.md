# 📡 IoT Android App – Geolocation & Orientation via WebSocket

This Android application was developed as part of an **IoT** project. It enables a smartphone connected to a Wi-Fi access point (typically from a microcontroller or embedded platform) to **send real-time geolocation and orientation data** and to **receive and display information about the network status and objects detected by other connected devices** via a **WebSocket connection**.

## 📱 Features

- ✅ Automatically connects to the WebSocket server when Wi-Fi is available
- 📍 Sends data every second:
  - **Latitude / Longitude**
  - **Speed** (m/s)
  - **Altitude** (m)
  - **Pitch / Roll / Azimut** (device orientation)
  - **Timestamp** (ISO 8601 UTC)
- 📶 Verifies Wi-Fi connectivity
- 📤 Transmits data using WebSocket in JSON format

- Android studio
- Java	Main programming language
- Android SDK	Access to sensors, location, permissions
- OkHttp WebSocket	Real-time WebSocket communication
- JSON	Data format for transmission
